## Summary:

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## commit.template

If you set this to the path of a file on your system, for instance consider a template file at                     `C:\CC_Applications/git-commit-template.txt` 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AnanthaRajuC/7c064859b3ef1c046c3070801e512001.js?file=git-commit-template.txt"></script>

Git will use this file as the default initial message when you commit. The value in creating a custom commit template is that you can use it to remind yourself (or others) of the proper format and style when creating a commit message.

[**Here**](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) is a template originally written by Tim Pope 

A sample command to set a commit.template is as follows:

`git config --global commit.template C:\CC_Applications/git-commit-template.txt` 

## A successful Git branching model

It is a development model introduced by <a href="https://nvie.com/about/" target="_blank" >Vincent Driessen</a> which helps form an elegant mental model that is easy to comprehend and allows team members to develop a shared understanding of the branching strategy and releasing management processes.
